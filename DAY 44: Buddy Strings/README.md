# Approach
 
It compares the characters of s and goal from both ends, identifying the first mismatched characters, if a mismatch is found, it swaps the characters at those positions and checks if the modified s is equal to goal.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: **O(N)**

- Space complexity: **O(N)**

# Explanation

- Get the length of string s and assign it to variable n.

- If s is equal to goal, check if the number of unique characters in s is less than the length of goal. If true, it means there are duplicate characters in s and swapping them would make s equal to goal.

- Initialize two pointers, i and j, pointing to the start and end of s respectively.

- Iterate while i is less than j and the characters at positions i in both s and goal are equal. Increment i by 1 in each iteration.

- Iterate while j is greater than or equal to 0 and the characters at positions j in both s and goal are equal. Decrement j by 1 in each iteration.

- If i is less than j, it means there are two different characters at positions i and j in s. Swap these characters by converting s to a list, swapping the characters at indices i and j, and then converting the list back to a string.

- Check if the modified s is equal to goal and return the result.
