# Approach

Using dynamic programming concept and checks the lengths of s1, s2, and s3 to see if they are compatible for interleaving. Uses memoization is used to avoid redundant calculations.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: **O(NM)**

- Space complexity: **O(NM)**

# Explanation

- Check if the lengths of s1 and s2 combined are equal to the length of s3. If not, returns False because it is impossible to form s3 by interleaving s1 and s2.

- Initialize a dictionary, dp, to store previously calculated results.

- Define a recursive helper function called solve that takes two indices, i and j, representing the current positions in s1 and s2, respectively.

- Check if both i and j have reached the end of their respective strings. If so, return True because s1 and s2 have been interleaved successfully to form s3.

- Check if the current indices (i, j) are already present in the dp dictionary. If so, return the corresponding result to avoid redundant calculations.

- Check if the current character from s1 matches the character at position (i+j) in s3, and recursively call solve with i+1 and j. If this recursive call returns True, it means that the remaining characters of s1 and s2 can be interleaved to form s3.

- Check if the current character from s2 matches the character at position (i+j) in s3, and recursively call solve with i and j+1. If this recursive call returns True, it means that the remaining characters of s1 and s2 can be interleaved to form s3.

- If none of the above conditions are met, set dp[(i,j)] to False to indicate that the current combination of characters from s1 and s2 cannot form s3.

- Return the result of the initial call to solve(0, 0), which represents the entire strings s1 and s2.
